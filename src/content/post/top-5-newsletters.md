I receive numerous newsletters in my email inbox. I'd wager they comprise around 95% of my email usage.

Here are my top 5 favorites:

## 1. Garbage Day

[Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/), founded by [Ryan Broderick](https://www.threads.net/@ryanhatesthis), covers everything online. It's the only newsletter I pay for.

## 2. Installer

I look forward to the [Installer](https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter) newsletter by [David Pierce](https://www.threads.net/@imdavidpierce) every Saturday. I love trying out new apps and workflows.

## 3. Yahoo Sports AM

I've followed [Kendall Baker](https://sports.yahoo.com/author/kendall-baker/) since his days at Axios, where he wrote the best sports newsletter. His move to Yahoo excited me, and [Yahoo Sports AM](https://sports.yahoo.com/newsletters/yahoo-sports-am/) didn't disappoint. It remains a must-read every morning for sports enthusiasts.

## 4. User Mag

Another favorite tech and online culture publication is[User Mag](https://www.usermag.co) by [Taylor Lorenz](https://substack.com/@taylorlorenz). It features exclusive reporting, interviews, and insights. My favorite section is "What I'm Reading," with its excellent article recommendations. I'm close to subscribing.

## 5. Morning Brew

[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/daily) is my longest-running subscription on this list. It's the best morning newsletter, covering essential topics while offering interesting insights and links.

## Honorable Mentions

- [Snaxshots](https://www.snaxshot.com/) - I **highly recommend** Snaxshots, its very close to making the top 5. [Andrea Hern√°ndez](https://www.foodandwine.com/fwpro/snaxhot-snack-expert-andrea-hernandez) expertly curates the food and beverage space, predicting emerging trends. Follow her on Instagram for [snack meme dumps](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB2IkbDu8eE/?hl=en&img_index=1).

- [Palm Report](https://www.palm.report/), an offshoot of the [Poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net/) music app this used to be amazing but they went to a pay model and really limited what is in the free version. That said it's good enough I have been going back and forth on paying and he did just add a new contributor. Once again the good life beckons.
