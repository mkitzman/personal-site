## 52 Things I learned this year

1.  A conservative estimate holds that there are 240 billion pennies lying around the United States — about 724 [$7.24) for every man, woman and child there residing. These are but a fraction of the several hundreds of billions of pennies issued since 1793, most of which have suffered a mysterious fate sometimes described in government records, with a hint of supernaturality generally undesirable in bookkeeping, as “disappearance.” As far as anyone knows, the American cent is the most produced coin in the history of civilization, its portrait of Lincoln the most reproduced piece of art on Earth. Although pennies are almost never used for their ostensible purpose [to make purchases), right now one out of every two circulating coins minted in the United States has a face value of 1 cent. A majority of the ones that have not yet disappeared are, according to a 2022 report, “sitting in consumers’ coin jars in their homes.” [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/01/magazine/worthless-pennies-united-states-economy.html?campaign_id=52&emc=edit_ma_20240907&instance_id=133661&nl=the-new-york-times-magazine&regi_id=91003723&segment_id=177137&te=1&user_id=e14a27fb6b9e6e33f12a82dd7803732e)

Just as the 10:10 position has long been considered the aesthetic ideal for hand position on the dial, Rolex has deemed 28 the most beautiful numerals to magnify under a cyclops lens.Luxury goods are status symbols, and anything can be a status symbol as long as it [1) has cachet, i.e. associations with high status groups [2) high signaling coststo prevent easy acquisition, and [3) an alibi for acquisition other than status signaling.
