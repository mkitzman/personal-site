I've finally launched a newly redesigned website. Unlike previous updates, where I would start from scratch and build it using my current programming language of choice, this time I took a different approach.

## Trying New Technologies

To expand my skills, I built this website using cutting-edge technologies. Specifically:

- **Astro**: A static site generator, similar to Gatsby, which I previously used for a design system at Medallia. However, I found Gatsby became unwieldy and slow over time.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For the base CSS, I'm giving Tailwind a try despite being familiar with and not particularly fond of utility CSS. Its popularity made it worth exploring.
- **Netlify**: Not actually new for me, I used it on my last site as well. Really love their service and the automated deploys.

This new website marks a fresh start, and I'm eager to see how these technologies perform.
