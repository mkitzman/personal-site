I love end-of-year lists. One of these days, I’m going to make a site that aggregates them all into one end-of-year list to rule them all.

## Top Artists

**Total Number of Different Artists:** 2,399

- **Fontaines D.C.** - My band and album of the year.
- **The Libertines** - Their latest album is _so_ good.
- **Tool** - Probably (?) my all-time favorite band and the only '90s band I still listen to regularly. Also, Adam Jones is my all-time favorite guitarist. I actually just got his guitar this week: the [ Adam Jones Les Paul Custom Art Collection: Frazetta “The Berserker”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIQLFRf6FWA)

## Top Songs

**Total Number of Different Songs:** 4,913

- **"Oh Shit" by The Libertines** - 46 plays. Great song, and 46 seems low.
- **"La Intención" by Christian Nodal & Peso Pluma** - 40 plays. I like this song, but I feel like I’ve played other songs way more.
- **"Midnight Butterflies" by Sea Girls** - 39 plays. Love this song, but I don’t really listen to any other songs from them.
- **"Supernatural" by Laura Jane Grace** - 38 plays. I _must_ have played this more. This is the singer from Against Me!.
- **"Starburster" by Fontaines D.C.** - 37 plays. No way this is right; I’ve played it a billion times. Song of the year.

## Top Albums

**Total Number of Different Albums:** 451

- **All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade" by The Libertines** - My second favorite album.
- **Fear Inoculum" by Tool** - This seems a little high.
- **Romance" by Fontaines D.C.** - Too low. Album of the year.
- **Foregone" by In Flames** - No way this is my 4th most listened-to album. Has to be a mistake.
- **Definitely Maybe" by Oasis** - No way this is top 5. My guess is it takes into account how many of the songs you listened to on an album, not how many times.
